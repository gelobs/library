This project is a small Library app. You can store books in the library, by giving the author's name, book's title, ISBN and the number of pages. I used the 'localStorage' property to store books in the browser, so every time you open the library page, the books you have added will be displayed in the screen. You can also set book's read status and remove books from the library. Many ideas for this implementation are taken from Traversy Media's [JavaScript BookList App | No Frameworks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMCxVWtW58). From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/library)
